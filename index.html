        <p>Hi! My name is Priyanshi Garg, and I am a sophomore at CMHS. I have been with Hack Club for a few months
            (started in August) and have been a part of the Daydream Charlotte, Daydream Global, and Parthenon (Athena
            Award) hackathons. I was actually the winner of Daydream Charlotte (along with Prisha and Shreyasi over
            here) and we placed in the top 25% in Daydream Global. I have experience with Python, HTML, CSS, some
            Javascript, and am currently learning APIs. I can't wait to meet everyone!</p>

        <h3>Boba Drops Workshop</h3>
        <h2>11/07/2025</h2>
        <p>Today we conducted the Boba Drops Workshop and this was also our first meeting. The members learned basic
            HTML and CSS for their submission. We plan on going more in depth in these two languages in the next meeting
            on the 21st. </p>
