                    Hi! My name is Priyanshi Garg, and I am a sophomore at CMHS. I have been with Hack Club for a few
                    months (started in August) and have been a part of the Daydream Charlotte, Daydream Global, and
                    Parthenon (Athena Award) hackathons. I was actually the winner of Daydream Charlotte (along with
                    Prisha and Shreyasi over here) and we placed in the top 25% in Daydream Global. I am currently
                    working towards Midnight (in Vienna, Austria) and Aces (in Washington, D.C). I have experience with
                    Python, HTML, CSS, some Javascript, and am currently learning APIs. I can't wait to meet everyone!

                    Hello! My name is Prisha Garg and I am a sophomore. I have been with Hackclub for almost half a year
                    now and I have been a part of Daydream and Parthenon (Athena Award, hackathon hosted in NYC) hosted
                    by them. I have experience in HTML, CSS, and some JS. I am currently working towards Aces.

                    Hello! I'm Shreyasi, and I'm a sophomore. I've been at Hack Club for a few months and have participated in events like Daydream Charlotte, Daydream Global, and (qualified) for the Athena Award. I'm currently working towards Moonshot! I wanted to help start a division of HC at our school because I found it so fun and fulfilling to code a project and get something in return. Not only that, but I've made numerous friends around the world as well.
