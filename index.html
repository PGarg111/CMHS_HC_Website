                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Hack Club was founded on the belief that high school students can accomplish extraordinary things
                    when
                    given
                    the right tools and space to create. Since its start, the organization has grown into an
                    international
                    movement of student-led clubs spanning numerous countries. Emphasizing open-source collaboration and
                    peer-to-peer learning, Hack Club continues to expand by empowering students to lead and innovate.
                </p>

                    projects,
                    nonprofits, and major hackathons. The organization remains driven by the creativity and passion of
                    students
                    who are committed to learning, experimenting, and making an impact.</p>

                        basic
                        HTML and CSS for their submission. I recorded the meeting for members to look back at when in

                        using
