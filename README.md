# CMHS_HC_Website

I created a website for the Hack Club that I started at my school. The website features information on the club founders and co-founders, the school we are affiliated with, a calendar with club meeting dates, and a tab that will features any Hackathons that we hosted (for the future). This website was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The user can navigate through the buttons in the topbar. The website also features a button to the very left in the topbar to switch between light and dark mode. 

People who attend the school we are affiliated with can submit a form that they are interested in joining (the form was created using JotForm). 

I made my website for others to learn about the club and get more people interested in Hack Club. 

The biggest challenge I faced when creating this website was making it look appealing. Since the bulk of this website was to make it look appealing to others, that part took the longest and was the hardest part. I usually use simple CSS with most of my websites, but this one had me looking for different ways to do things. For example, the topbar is usually solid with color and static. After looking at others personal websites, I though of adding some different elements to it. That's how I thought of making it with no background and used the hover pseudo-class more by adding colors when hovering and shadows. I also added smooth transtions.
